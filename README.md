# Redux Road
A simple adventure game using reducers, state, and actions. 

The game state contains the player’s inventory, distance travelled, cash, and time on the road. Each event in the game is represented as an action. Players can gather supplies, travel, and–if they play risky–sometimes tip over the wagon carrying their supplies.
